# Stocks-Dash-Forecaster
A web application is created using a Python framework called Dash that displays company information and plots daily stocks prices and the stocks' exponential moving average(EMA). The information is fetched using the yfinance library.
Also, a machine learning model(Support Vector Machine) is implemented to forecast stock prices for the number of days inputted by the user.
